Deep Reinforcement Learning
## Prerequisites and setup
### Background needed
* basic concepts of reinforcement learning. A helpful introduction to reinforcement learning can be [found here by Professor Emma Brunskill, Stanford University](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOSOPzutgyCTapiGlY2Nd8u) you'll get DQN in lecture 6
* I also highly recommend [this course by Professor Yann LeCun, winner of 2018 ACM A.M. Turing Award, and Alfredo Canziani, NYU](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLHTzKZzVU9e6xUfG10TkTWApKSZCzuBI)
* you can find more on the Internet but remember "Stand on the Shoulders of Giants"
## My Envinronment Setup
* Anaconda
* Keras v2.4.3 on Tensorflow v2.3 & CUDA 10
## Simulator
[Airsim](https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/) in the landscape environment
